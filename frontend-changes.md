# Frontend Changes - Toggle Button Design Implementation

## Overview
Implemented a theme toggle button feature with sun/moon icons, positioned in the top-right corner of the application header. The toggle button provides smooth animations and full accessibility support.

## Files Created/Modified

### 1. `index.html`
- Created main HTML structure with semantic header and main content areas
- Added theme toggle button with proper ARIA labels and accessibility attributes
- Positioned toggle button in the top-right corner of the header
- Included sun (‚òÄÔ∏è) and moon (üåô) emoji icons for visual clarity

### 2. `styles.css`
- Implemented CSS custom properties (variables) for theme switching
- Created light and dark theme color schemes using `[data-theme="dark"]` selector
- Added smooth transition animations (0.3s ease) for all theme-related changes
- Styled toggle button with:
  - Rounded pill shape (50px border-radius)
  - Hover effects with subtle transform and shadow
  - Focus indicators for keyboard accessibility
  - Icon positioning and animation effects
- Implemented responsive design for mobile devices
- Added `prefers-reduced-motion` support for accessibility

### 3. `script.js`
- Created `ThemeToggle` class for managing theme state and interactions
- Features implemented:
  - **Theme Persistence**: Saves user preference to localStorage
  - **System Theme Detection**: Respects user's OS dark/light mode preference
  - **Keyboard Navigation**: Supports Enter and Space key activation
  - **Accessibility**: Updates ARIA labels dynamically
  - **System Theme Changes**: Listens for OS theme changes and updates accordingly
  - **Focus Management**: Enhanced focus states for better UX
